class BlockCommand(Command):
    '''
    Base class for any block commands that accept multiple statements from the
    user. Block commands allow the user to input several individual statement
    lines and postpone processing and execution until a later time. For
    example, the :class:`pypsi.commands.macro.MacroCommand` is a block command
    that allows the user to record several statements and then execute them
    when the macro is called.
