class Plugin(object):
    '''
    A plugin is an object that is able to modify a :py:class:`pypsi.shell.Shell`
    object's behavior. Whereas a command can be execute from user input, the
    `Plugin` class does not contain a `run()` function.
    '''

    def __init__(self, preprocess=None, postprocess=None):
        '''
        Constructor can take two parameters: `preprocess` and `postprocess`. These
        values determine where the plugin resides inside of the preprocess and
        postprocess list. This list, inside of :class:`pypsi.shell.Shell`, is iterated
        sequentially, from most priority to least. So, the highest priority
        value is 0, which means it will be the first plugin to run, and the
        lowest value is 100, which means it will be the last plugin to run. If
        either value is `None`, the plugin is not added to the processing list.
        For example, if this plugin only provides a preprocessing functionality,
        then postprocess should be set to :const:`None`.

        :param int preprocess: the preprocess priority
        :param int postprocess: the postprocess priority

        :param pypsi.shell.Shell shell: the active shell
        :returns int: 0 on success, -1 on failure
        '''
        return 0

    def on_input(self, shell, line):
        '''
        Called after input from the user has been received. The return value is
        the preprocessed line. This means that modifying the line argument will
        not populate back. If this function does no preprocessing, return line
        unmodified.

        :param pypsi.shell.Shell shell: the active shell
        :param str line: the current input statement string
        :returns str: the preprocessed line

        return line

    def on_tokenize(self, shell, tokens, origin):
        '''
        Called after an input string has been tokenized. If this function
        performs no preprocessing, return the tokens unmodified.

        :param pypsi.shell.Shell shell: the active shell
        :param list tokens: the list of :class:`pypsi.cmdline.Token` objects
        :param str origin: the origin of the input, can be either 'input' if
            received from a call to `input()` or 'prompt' if the input is the
            prompt to display to the user
        :returns list: the list of preprocessed :class:`pypsi.cmdline.Token`
            objects
        '''
        return tokens

    def on_input_canceled(self, shell):
        '''
        Called when the user can canceled entering a statement via SIGINT
        (Ctrl+C).

        :param pypsi.shell.Shell shell: the active shell
        :returns int: 0 on success, -1 on error
        '''
        return 0

    def on_statement_finished(self, shell):
        '''
        Called when a statement has been completely executed.

        :param pypsi.shell.Shell shell: the active shell
        :returns int: 0 on success, -1 on error
        '''
        return 0


class Command(object):
    '''
    A pluggable command that users can execute. All commands need to derive from
    this class. When a command is executed by a user, the command's :meth:`run`
    method will be called. The return value of the :meth:`run` method is used
    when processing forthcoming commands in the active statement. The return
    value must be an :class:`int` and follows the Unix standard: 0 on success,
    less than 0 on error, and greater than 0 given invalid input or incorrect
    usage.

    Each command has a topic associated with it. This topic can be referenced by
    commands such as :class:`pypsi.commands.help.HelpCommand` to categorize
    commands in help messages.

    A command can be used as a fallback handler by implementing the
    :meth:`fallback` method. This is similar to the :meth:`run` method, except
    that is accepts one more argument: the command name to execute that wasn't
    found by the shell. The return value of :meth:`fallback` holds the same
    purpose as the return value of :meth:`run`.

    By the time :meth:`run` is called, the system streams have been updated to
    point to the current file streams. This means that the statement context's
    system streams are the same as the global streams in the :mod:`sys` module.
    For example, to write to `stdout`, a command may perform any of the
    following in the :meth:`run` method, all of which are equivalent:

    - ``ctx.stdout.write("Hello\\n")``
    - ``sys.stdout.write("Hello\\n")``
    - ``print("Hello")``
